You really need to see a psychiatrist if you suspect mania. Hypomania is the glorious part of bipolar. The euphoria, high energy even with low sleep, hypersexuality and confidence are fun and enjoyable. The problem is Hypomania, where you can function, can turn into mania, leading to psychosis and dumb actions hurting yourself or someone else. Mania typically lands someone in jail or psych hospital. Even if you don't get into mania, hypomania turns into depression and the depression can be bad enough to try and commit suicide. I know there's disadvantages to an official diagnosis, but treatment matters in giving you higher quality of life. Having a bipolar diagnosis does not automatically disqualify you from nursing, but it does create barriers.\n", '</post>\n', '\n', '

I try to hide the symptoms but weird fucken shit always always always happened..... people would give me the weirdest looks and they were just like "what the fuck." Didnt help that I worked at hooters, so all the girls thought I was a fucking weirdo, which I am. Lol. I hope to find a team one day that will accept me and know who I really am, which takes a long time because I have sooo many "faces." I dont trust anyone right now. They seem so supportive but I truly think it is being cause they are curious because they have not met or experienced someone like me before. They just think I am funny and dont understand I have feelings too, as I always feel like the joke, so I dont trust their intentions of hanging out with me. I also feel as if one person told another, and the word has gotten around so these social groups look at me weird. Let me mind you that I am currently a senior in college and randomly used to throw giant house parties in my off campus house, in the basement, with kegs, a DJ, jello shots, pong and also I charged people at the door 2 bucks to chill and 5 for a cup lol...mania!

I will blurt something out and give a rant then after realize that i just did it again and say sorry. Then 2 seconds later i would be on to something else and totally forget that i was not supposed to be talking lol.

If i reread it i will rewrite it again cause i have an entire new set of ideas and whatever i just wrote sounds ridiculous, but then the next one is just as worse because i dont have it in me.

I teeter back and forth between feeling like I definitely *do* have a correct diagnosis of both bipolar disorder and ADHD, and feeling like its truly just ADHD and my bipolar disorder diagnosis was made too hastily. So its tough; I understand what you're going through.\n", '\n', "I take Lamictal and Depakote for Bipolar disorder, Intuniv and Vyvanse for ADHD, as well as Lexapro for anxiety; I as well am on 5 medications (although I take medication holidays from Vyvanse on days when I don't have school/work and on the weekends). So I, like you, also take Lamictal. Since starting it, I feel like it has definitely leveled out my moods and protects me from falling too deeply into depression. **But** Lamictal (and Depakote) can be beneficial for those with ADHD who have rapidly changing moods and impulsivity, as well. So responding well/poorly to Lamictal (or any mood stabilizer, actually) isn't a clear indicator of Bipolar Disorder. On the flip side, Intuniv (similar to clonidine) has been life changing for my ADHD, more so than any stimulant I've tried. So clearly, gauging how accurate a disorder is based on responses to medications is super difficult.\n", '\n', 'One thing to keep in mind is that ADHD medications, specifically the stimulants like Adderall, Vyvanse, Concerta, Ritalin, etc. will make *anyone* feel better. Their effect isn\'t exclusive to patients with ADHD. Anyone who takes them will have increased energy/productivity/attention span/focus, all to some degree. So in that sense specifically, responding well to ADHD medication doesn\'t indicate an ADHD diagnosis. I don\'t mean to say this applies to you, as you already *have* an ADHD diagnosis. But as a general rule of thumb for others, people shouldn\'t assume that feeling amazing when taking Adderall means they "need" it. After all, its an amphetamine...anyone who takes an upper is going to feel "up".\n', '\n', "Sorry for the length of this post. I'm just realizing I'm being kinda wordy. At the end of the day, my advice is to remember that ADHD and Bipolar, just like any other mental health diagnoses, can occur simultaneously. Its not uncommon to have both. Actually, for patients who do have a comorbidity, Bipolar and ADHD is one of the more common. So don't let the amount of medications you take scare you. Try to remember that each one plays a role, and its more important that you feel better on five medications than feeling worse by only taking 3. I struggled with that thought process for a while, so I understand where you're coming from.\n", '</post>\n', '\n', '

I was diagnosed ADHD very young and with anxiety / mild depression later in life which remained untreated until I became bi-polar and out of control in a completely manic episode. Sought treatment and a psych evaluation after my immediate family started showing concern. I\'ve always had a bad temper and anger issues which includes extreme outbursts, even damaging my own home more than once. I\'m usually grouchy, sarcastic and defensive. My wife and brother call it "don\'t poke the bear" attitude. Once my wife realized I was manic and rapidly cycling bi-polar she asked that I get a psychiatric evaluation and they kept me for 3 days in a crisis management unit. After my little vacation to the psych ward for 3 days I was put on Depakote which helps a ton and Vistaril which I use on an as needed basis for panic attacks. The Depakote helps you stop and think before talking or acting out. It lubricates the little part of your brain that is responsible for this thought process. Anger issues and especially the outbursts are the worst. Hurting those closest to you and not allowing others to get close to you. It happens so fast. But the psych meds have helped and even just a clear diagnosis has helped. I start back therapy with my counselor later this month. I have been on and off adderall and other adhd stims almost my whole life. After detoxing and focusing on my anxiety &amp; sobriety (not drinking is key!)

I had the worst depression that I've experienced in years just last month and it was always worse when my daughter was with her father, but knowing that I am the reason this amazing brilliant beautiful person is here gave me something to hold on to. And when I was manic I was impulsive, but it never effected her. Half of my debt is from shit I bought her. If anything being a little crazy, creative and imaginative makes me more fun. My promiscuity only occurs when she is at her dads house. I am grateful every single day that she has allowed me to hold on to reality enough for her to not know that her moms brain works different than the large majority of the population. \n", '\n', '\n', "You know bipolar could add extra challenges to your future family, but you have to remember every family has its challenges but doesn't always know what they are till it's to late.

Started with alcohol at 19 before I knew I was bipolar (I always thought I had just depression and social anxiety). Then weed a few years later at 20. Then rolled for the first time around 21 and felt what it was like to be happy and anxiety free. After that I was hooked. Next up was cocaine at a company Xmas party at 22. Got addicted to that one pretty hard. LSD/Mushrooms shortly after, I couldn't get enough of that happy feeling and intense reflective thought. I credit some breakthroughs I had to psychedelics. \n", '\n', "So then I was loaded several nights a week (mainly weed, alcohol, and coke) with the income to afford it. At about age 24 1/2 the comedown anxiety started hitting. Hard. Couple of scares and ER trips later I began to back off coke. Then at 26, last year, I wanted to cut out alcohol after I made some decisions that don't reflect who I want to be as a person (mainly cheating on GFs, and also occasionally doing coke). Got on the path of sobriety with a therapist and Psychiatrist, got diagnosed with BP2 and tried a variety of meds. Was 9 months coke free, and 6 months alcohol free at my peak.\n", '\n', "But eventually I stopped the meds. Most had been given me bad side effects, and one (either Lamictal or Klonopin) was making my hair thin out. Being the 4th round of meds I was trying I got frustrated and gave up (this was also maybe the 10th set of meds I had tried in total, when I was originally being treated for depression throughout my early 20s). So I went back to recreational MDMA every now and then. Then NYE I made the conscious decision to drink and roll in Las Vegas. No stupid decisions made. No poor life choices. No coke. So I thought I had it under control. Fast forward this past Friday I get fucking loaded on alcohol and there's coke and so I do it. Comedown wasn't terrible but it reminded me partially why I stopped drinking in the first place. \n", '\n', "So now I'm trying to figure out what my next steps are. Give Lamictal another shot? Something else? I definitely need to stay away from alcohol if I don't want to do coke. But man when something triggers a depressive episode (like today) my self worth goes out the window, and I feel isolated from anyone who cares about me (does anyone?). Which makes me want to drink. I may feel shitty tomorrow but at least I won't feel shitty tonight too.\n", '</post>\n', '\n', '

My dad was also 60 at the time I did the involuntary commitment, and his symptoms had getting worse over a number of years. \n', '\n', "The main reason I chose to do the involuntary commitment was because he had a pending felony court case and his actions were likely to cause him to get more charges filed against him. My sister and I did research long ago to prep for this day so we finally decided to enact our plan because this was getting into last resort territory. Using involuntary commitment, as I think you know, should be used as a last resort if you think she is a danger to herself or to others. Karen is going to be super pissed off during this time and probably afterwards. You should probably prepare for that and be prepared to hear some awful things. The benefit of involuntary commitment for me was that I got a diagnosis of bipolar and alcoholism. Before I only had alcoholism and a feeling there was a mental illness involved. Karen is diagnosed so you wouldn't get this same benefit. After my dad was released, he was still in absolute denial that anything was wrong with him and that he was going to sue me for filing a false report (lawsuit never happened). At least Karen is aware of the diagnosis and I don't know if she accepts it. She may realize how much you helped her after some time after the involuntary commitment. Just going to be honest here, my dad pretty much blames me for all his problems after the involuntary commitment even though I'm in a city far away. The chance of Karen not trusting your bf is there.

Like someone else has said, explain your feelings, offer help (with boundaries), and just accept whatever answer she gives you, good or bad.

Know the law and the procedure. If possible, figure out Karen's medical insurance information or take a picture of her insurance card. This way, if the worst happens, then you'll be ready. Also vet out the place you want to take her and their requirements/costs. Involuntary commitment isn't free (at least in area) so be aware of any deductible that may need to be paid. I know living in a rural area, it might be tough to find a place close by, but just realize it's a short stay. It's just to help Karen stabilize.\n", "3) Learn more about bipolar. You're on this subreddit. Great start! There is also BipolarSOs.\n", "4) Realize your limits and think about your boundaries.

And that frustrates me.\n', '\n', "Basically, if we are not well, it's easy to let it become who we are, and there's oftentimes little we can do to change that, since the illness needs our immediate attention to heal. But if you're exclusively paying attention to it not for the sake of getting better, but when you are able to function at a moderate-to-high level, that might be overkill. But still, tough question, I don't even know that I'm right.\n", '</post>\n', '\n', '

Reading your story, I was reminded so much of what happened to me in college. I didn\'t know I was ill - I wasn\'t diagnosed until decades later. I hear you talking a lot about your tendency to compare yourself and your life to others. This was really hard for me too, but what I had to ultimately reach - and I know you\'ll get there in time - was a mindset that basically placed me in my own special trajectory - and part of it was realizing that no one really understood (except my therapist) how fucking hard it is to operate normally under the conditions of our illness. School takes incredible discipline, and the stress is unbearable even without dealing with bipolar, so the fact that you\'ve made it this far is such a testament to your determination. I\'m really sorry your parents aren\'t more supportive. Maybe you could buy them a book about it or something, mail it to them, say "Mom, Dad - I am really struggling and I really need you. I want you to read this so you can better understand me." That being said, it may be too much to ask to have someone who has never struggled truly understand and offer the kind of empathy you truly deserve.

You\'re going to find your way through, and you\'re going to learn how to take good care of yourself along the way.

The therapy sessions then served as a means of regrouping, going over where I succeeded, where I failed, and thinking of new ways to overcome any setbacks and move forward (it helped that I gave my consent for my counselor and psychiatrist to share information, especially since my counselor was the one who saw the red flags and referred me for my inevitable diagnosis of bipolar II and a year later, ADHD).\n", '\n', "Sorry if I rambled on a little bit there. **TL;DR**: In my experience, anxiety and bipolar were not inseparable; therefore, they needed to be treated as equal problems and required a team effort between me, my psychologist, and my psychiatrist.

I hadn't really thought about their perspective and need for processing or juust being hosed. I guess I might not be ok again yet. My therapist found out because she saw me in the middle of the episode and became concerned (I was still in denial and was even thinking that being hypomanic was good for me), but my psychiatrist doesn't know yet. I didn't tell her about last time, because it was so brief and I honestly forgot in the middle of craziness from the semester. I'm scared to tell her about this time though. I'm scared she might try to put me on an atypical antipsychotic. I've been on several in the past, though not at the same time, as people where trying to control my depression that wasn't responding to SSRIs or SNRIs, my panic disorder that was only responding to daily high doses of benzos, and also for controlling a movement disorder that I eventually learned to control without meds. I think I've been on zyprexa, risperidone, abilify, Seroquel, and maybe others that I'm forgetting. They all made me feel like a zombie, like I am emotionally flat, slow down my cognitive activity significantly, make me sleep stupid amounts like 12-16 hours/day consistently, and make me gain weight. Another thing I'm afraid of is that she will decide I can't be on stimulants. I got diagnosed with ADHD several months ago (and told it was strongly suspected by several mental health professionals years ago and recognized the symptoms that where appendant since early childhood but I didn't think where atypical. I grew up in a household without health insurance, a strong distrust of American doctors, and no notion of the existence of mh issues, but I digress.), but didn't start medication until a couple of months ago because I was dealing with more pressing issues. We have only tried Concerta so far, and at lower doses I felt no effects, either side effects or benefits. However ever since we switched to 54mg I have been able to actually complete activities and stopped being retarded and forgetting why I wandered into a room, and had minimal side effects. I started on this dose a couple of weeks ago, so I don't think it is the instigator, but I'm afraid she will decide it's too risky. \n", '\n', 'Edit: grammar and words\n', '</post>\n', '\n', '

I thought I'd finally discovered the secret to life. But because I'd not been diagnosed, I wasn't medicated and went fully manic at a yoga studio after a week of limited sleep. Was hospitalized, then diagnosed. Lol super embarrassing and painful, but also ridiculously funny (in retrospect).\n", '\n', "I'll be practicing from home this year to avoid over-stimulation by other people (yogaglo.com offers great online classes), scheduling my days pretty rigidly, meditating, taking medicine, getting sleep (and taking the trazodone if I don't), and keeping in close contact with pdoc. Also I've been really open with my family, who are very supportive, so I hope all of that along with medication will help this year. But I'd be lying if I said I wasn't nervous... Mania had some serious consequences for me last year.\n", '\n', '</post>\n', '\n', '

I just saw my family doc for it.  I was completely oblivious to my manic episodes in the past.  I wanted to try a new antidepressant because of side effects of the one I was on but when we changed them I spun into possibly the worst depression I'd ever had.  When I saw my doc he said he wanted me to see a psychiatrist.  Not because he thought it might be bipolar or anything else, just because I had gotten so much worse.\n", '\n', 'So I got in with a psych and we started talking about everything.  Not "symptoms," just started with my depression and then asked me about other parts of my life.  She suggested that I might be bipolar then gave me some stuff to read, told me to go home and think about it.  Maybe ask the people I was closest to, without bringing up the word bipolar, for some of their observations.  I did that and the next time I went back she asked me how I felt about it.  It made sense but I didn\'t really want to be diagnosed, obviously.  So we decided to try a mood stabilizer.  It worked.  I kept seeing her and the more we talked the more confident she was in the diagnosis.\n', '\n', "Honestly I think that's how it should always be.  I feel like the diagnosis gets thrown around too much some times.  Bipolar is about extremes.  People have depressive moods and sometimes they have up moods and then it's like hey, that sounds like bipolar based on this vague listing of symptoms I read online (not saying this is your case at all).  It should be a conversation with your doc about how you feel, what's been going on, and then they make a diagnosis as a medical professional.  I know people who were misdiagnosed bipolar and honestly looking back they said they brought it up to their doctor and then told them what behaviors fit but left out the things that maybe didn't. The meds are not fun for anyone but I can tell you that as someone who was diagnosed incorrectly originally (just depression) being on the wrong meds is also horrible because then you're on this roller coaster ride with drugs that are making changes to your brain chemistry that aren't right.\n", '\n', "My recommendation is a 1:1 conversation with your doc for the first visit to start with and talking about everything you're feeling without bringing bipolar into the picture right away.  Bring your husband if that makes you feel comfortable, but I have found that having someone with me, even people I'm 1000% comfortable with, does change the things I talk about and if they pipe in then it's their observations of your feelings instead of your own.  Not that those observations aren't valuable, they very much are.  But it can change the course of the conversation.  And I strongly recommend you see a psych for a diagnosis (not sure if you're seeing your family doctor).

It's not enough to make it difficult to function, just enough to piss me off a little bit when I forget something---and nobody notices but me. To make up for this, I made a concious effort to write down important things (currently with [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com/) and Google Calendar) which helped a lot. When I first started taking Lamictal, my doctor also warned me about the cognitive side effects and told me to let her know if it started interfering with my school work, which honestly scared me quite a bit. But, the reality turned out to be fine. I made it through undergraduate and graduate school and several internships while having these side effects and still did well.

In my state the options are often dismal but every county has at least one lower cost option for therapy called sliding fee. Sliding fee goes off your income and lower income pays less. No unlimited therapy options outside of school, most of these practices are overwhelmed and the pdoc's aren't as good. Other states may be more flexible and pay more, but really in USA you have 50 different mental health systems through the states . I'm still on Obamacare, but very nervous because the media sounds as if they'll repeal it and wham all subsidies get dropped right away. I'll be highly affected if ACA is repealed. Mainly because now I get help paying for insurance so I have really good coverage at a low price. The other biggie is pre-existing conditions. Before ACA when I tried to get insurance after my diagnosis no insurance company would touch me except for a $550-600 coverage from my former employment. That was called COBRA and they had to offer it for like 18 months. Fortunately I started school again and student health insurance was what I had. The student health insurance was basically a catastrophe plan. If I got very sick it helped cover the hospital and it covered meds, but copays were high, $50-60 to see a specialist. The good part was at a university student health insurance covers pdoc and therapists for free if you go to their student health center. I'm blessed because I've never gone without insurance since my diagnosis, but that's also due to my parents helping me pay for insurance a lot of the time.

I had no idea how I was going to go about fixing any of this at the time, but one thing I knew for sure was that until I had a better grip on my mental health, romantic relationships had to stop. In fact, I realized I had better learn how to actively suppress just about every urge or instinct I had when it came to dating or romantic feelings because falling deeply for someone only to have my mental health inevitably be the root of our relationship's failure, only served to make the self-loathing worse.\n", '\n', "Seeing as how dysfunctional I already was, and just how erratic and unreliable my moods were becoming, making the decision to step away from dating altogether was easy, and allowed me to just focus on myself completely.

Classic manic-depression runs in my family, so I've always been aware of the signs of that, but as I've never had the classic polar shifts between hypermania and major depression (in fact, I've never once had a hypermanic phase at all), I was quite certain that what I was dealing with wasn't bipolar disorder.\n", '\n', "Until I met with this new doctor, I had never heard of mixed bipolar disorder (or a mixed affective state), and I never knew that there are more subtle signs of mania that exist outside the stereotypical hypermanic phase I saw four months out of the year with my mom. Symptoms like racing thoughts (which I've always had and affect my ability to sleep), and feeling utterly depressed despite being at a point where I was also feeling better than ever are two of the biggest red flags. The other, bigger one, though, was the fact that when I first started taking antidepressants at 16, I felt their effects immediately; the first time I took Zoloft, I was wired for two days and couldn't sleep.

It got better... but for me, medication was the key, and it has been for the entirety of my life since diagnosis.

The overall sluggishness can be overcome, but it does take time and effort. For me, it took medication and a lot of visits to my psychiatrist. I'd also recommend doing something challenging - maybe something like learning a language. That sounds really fucking stupid, I know, but you might be shocked at what a difference it can make. Learning Spanish is actually what got me through college in good enough standing to have professors tell me to continue my education... it helps make your mind sharper and more fluid - and, honestly, it only takes a little bit of improvement for you to start feeling a lot better. \n", '\n', "Your mind recovers, it's just really slow progress. The sluggishness and inability to concentrate is also, at least in my case, a symptom that something still isn't quite right - this is usually when make sure I've been taking my medication on time, etc, because when my mind wanders like that and I stop being able to do my work, it's a warning sign of impending instability. \n", '\n', "Anyway! You can recover... your brain can get back into shape. It needs exercise and some TLC lol, but it will work again.

I hope to find a team one day that will accept me and know who I really am, which takes a long time because I have sooo many "faces." I dont trust anyone right now. They seem so supportive but I truly think it is being cause they are curious because they have not met or experienced someone like me before.

So its tough; I understand what you're going through.\n", '\n', "I take Lamictal and Depakote for Bipolar disorder, Intuniv and Vyvanse for ADHD, as well as Lexapro for anxiety; I as well am on 5 medications (although I take medication holidays from Vyvanse on days when I don't have school/work and on the weekends). So I, like you, also take Lamictal. Since starting it, I feel like it has definitely leveled out my moods and protects me from falling too deeply into depression. **But** Lamictal (and Depakote) can be beneficial for those with ADHD who have rapidly changing moods and impulsivity, as well. So responding well/poorly to Lamictal (or any mood stabilizer, actually) isn't a clear indicator of Bipolar Disorder. On the flip side, Intuniv (similar to clonidine) has been life changing for my ADHD, more so than any stimulant I've tried. So clearly, gauging how accurate a disorder is based on responses to medications is super difficult.\n", '\n', 'One thing to keep in mind is that ADHD medications, specifically the stimulants like Adderall, Vyvanse, Concerta, Ritalin, etc. will make *anyone* feel better. Their effect isn\'t exclusive to patients with ADHD. Anyone who takes them will have increased energy/productivity/attention span/focus, all to some degree. So in that sense specifically, responding well to ADHD medication doesn\'t indicate an ADHD diagnosis. I don\'t mean to say this applies to you, as you already *have* an ADHD diagnosis. But as a general rule of thumb for others, people shouldn\'t assume that feeling amazing when taking Adderall means they "need" it. After all, its an amphetamine...anyone who takes an upper is going to feel "up".\n', '\n', "Sorry for the length of this post. I'm just realizing I'm being kinda wordy. At the end of the day, my advice is to remember that ADHD and Bipolar, just like any other mental health diagnoses, can occur simultaneously. Its not uncommon to have both. Actually, for patients who do have a comorbidity, Bipolar and ADHD is one of the more common. So don't let the amount of medications you take scare you. Try to remember that each one plays a role, and its more important that you feel better on five medications than feeling worse by only taking 3. I struggled with that thought process for a while, so I understand where you're coming from.\n", '</post>\n', '\n', '

I was diagnosed ADHD very young and with anxiety / mild depression later in life which remained untreated until I became bi-polar and out of control in a completely manic episode. Sought treatment and a psych evaluation after my immediate family started showing concern. I\'ve always had a bad temper and anger issues which includes extreme outbursts, even damaging my own home more than once. I\'m usually grouchy, sarcastic and defensive. My wife and brother call it "don\'t poke the bear" attitude. Once my wife realized I was manic and rapidly cycling bi-polar she asked that I get a psychiatric evaluation and they kept me for 3 days in a crisis management unit. After my little vacation to the psych ward for 3 days I was put on Depakote which helps a ton and Vistaril which I use on an as needed basis for panic attacks. The Depakote helps you stop and think before talking or acting out. It lubricates the little part of your brain that is responsible for this thought process. Anger issues and especially the outbursts are the worst. Hurting those closest to you and not allowing others to get close to you. It happens so fast. But the psych meds have helped and even just a clear diagnosis has helped. I start back therapy with my counselor later this month. I have been on and off adderall and other adhd stims almost my whole life. After detoxing and focusing on my anxiety &amp; sobriety (not drinking is key!) I realized maybe my adhd was just a symptom of my extreme anxiety and constant panic attacks. Fear is the motivator behind all of my anger and outbursts.

And in limited situations where a person really can't afford to go to a doctor or it's unsafe to, then careful, educated self-diagnosis and self-help might be better than nothing, especially since you can't prescribe yourself meds anyway and it's going to be more along the lines of using a therapy workbook or trying to pick healthy habits in general.

I kept thinking about the terms psychosis, delusions, and all that and had an identity crisis because I thought I just enjoyed having  a good time occasionally and was the life of the party type. Then I was wondering if anything I did was actually me or the bipolar. Now I realize the symptoms CAN be bad and interfere with life, but they can range and be mild and it's nothing to be ashamed to admit and sometimes it'll over take you, but that isn't what defines you. Plus, my only real life experience with bipolar was my friend's dad who would range from being sweet, shy, and having terrible social anxiety to full on pill binges and would drive while high and got into a few serious wrecks. I guess my take away is that it's more complex than I thought and before I didn't want to think that I would be like my friend's dad and make decisions that hurt the people I love. \n", '</post>\n', '\n', '

Reading your story, I was reminded so much of what happened to me in college. I didn\'t know I was ill - I wasn\'t diagnosed until decades later. I hear you talking a lot about your tendency to compare yourself and your life to others. This was really hard for me too, but what I had to ultimately reach - and I know you\'ll get there in time - was a mindset that basically placed me in my own special trajectory - and part of it was realizing that no one really understood (except my therapist) how fucking hard it is to operate normally under the conditions of our illness. School takes incredible discipline, and the stress is unbearable even without dealing with bipolar, so the fact that you\'ve made it this far is such a testament to your determination. I\'m really sorry your parents aren\'t more supportive. Maybe you could buy them a book about it or something, mail it to them, say "Mom, Dad - I am really struggling and I really need you. I want you to read this so you can better understand me."

The therapy sessions then served as a means of regrouping, going over where I succeeded, where I failed, and thinking of new ways to overcome any setbacks and move forward (it helped that I gave my consent for my counselor and psychiatrist to share information, especially since my counselor was the one who saw the red flags and referred me for my inevitable diagnosis of bipolar II and a year later, ADHD).\n", '\n', "Sorry if I rambled on a little bit there. **TL;DR**: In my experience, anxiety and bipolar were not inseparable; therefore, they needed to be treated as equal problems and required a team effort between me, my psychologist, and my psychiatrist.

I hadn't really thought about their perspective and need for processing or juust being hosed. I guess I might not be ok again yet. My therapist found out because she saw me in the middle of the episode and became concerned (I was still in denial and was even thinking that being hypomanic was good for me), but my psychiatrist doesn't know yet. I didn't tell her about last time, because it was so brief and I honestly forgot in the middle of craziness from the semester. I'm scared to tell her about this time though. I'm scared she might try to put me on an atypical antipsychotic. I've been on several in the past, though not at the same time, as people where trying to control my depression that wasn't responding to SSRIs or SNRIs, my panic disorder that was only responding to daily high doses of benzos, and also for controlling a movement disorder that I eventually learned to control without meds. I think I've been on zyprexa, risperidone, abilify, Seroquel, and maybe others that I'm forgetting. They all made me feel like a zombie, like I am emotionally flat, slow down my cognitive activity significantly, make me sleep stupid amounts like 12-16 hours/day consistently, and make me gain weight. Another thing I'm afraid of is that she will decide I can't be on stimulants. I got diagnosed with ADHD several months ago (and told it was strongly suspected by several mental health professionals years ago and recognized the symptoms that where appendant since early childhood but I didn't think where atypical. I grew up in a household without health insurance, a strong distrust of American doctors, and no notion of the existence of mh issues, but I digress.), but didn't start medication until a couple of months ago because I was dealing with more pressing issues. We have only tried Concerta so far, and at lower doses I felt no effects, either side effects or benefits. However ever since we switched to 54mg I have been able to actually complete activities and stopped being retarded and forgetting why I wandered into a room, and had minimal side effects. I started on this dose a couple of weeks ago, so I don't think it is the instigator, but I'm afraid she will decide it's too risky. \n", '\n', 'Edit: grammar and words\n', '</post>\n', '\n', '

Not "symptoms," just started with my depression and then asked me about other parts of my life.

Maybe ask the people I was closest to, without bringing up the word bipolar, for some of their observations.  I did that and the next time I went back she asked me how I felt about it.

People have depressive moods and sometimes they have up moods and then it's like hey, that sounds like bipolar based on this vague listing of symptoms I read online (not saying this is your case at all).  It should be a conversation with your doc about how you feel, what's been going on, and then they make a diagnosis as a medical professional.  I know people who were misdiagnosed bipolar and honestly looking back they said they brought it up to their doctor and then told them what behaviors fit but left out the things that maybe didn't.

And I strongly recommend you see a psych for a diagnosis (not sure if you're seeing your family doctor).

It's not enough to make it difficult to function, just enough to piss me off a little bit when I forget something---and nobody notices but me.

If you're concerned, go see one. Worst case scenario is that you have a mental illness and that you have to start treatment. This results in you feeling better. Best case scenario is that you go and it turns out you don't have a mental illness, but maybe you could use a little counseling. This would likely make you feel better too.

In my state the options are often dismal but every county has at least one lower cost option for therapy called sliding fee. Sliding fee goes off your income and lower income pays less. No unlimited therapy options outside of school, most of these practices are overwhelmed and the pdoc's aren't as good. Other states may be more flexible and pay more, but really in USA you have 50 different mental health systems through the states . I'm still on Obamacare, but very nervous because the media sounds as if they'll repeal it and wham all subsidies get dropped right away. I'll be highly affected if ACA is repealed. Mainly because now I get help paying for insurance so I have really good coverage at a low price. The other biggie is pre-existing conditions. Before ACA when I tried to get insurance after my diagnosis no insurance company would touch me except for a $550-600 coverage from my former employment. That was called COBRA and they had to offer it for like 18 months. Fortunately I started school again and student health insurance was what I had. The student health insurance was basically a catastrophe plan. If I got very sick it helped cover the hospital and it covered meds, but copays were high, $50-60 to see a specialist. The good part was at a university student health insurance covers pdoc and therapists for free if you go to their student health center. I'm blessed because I've never gone without insurance since my diagnosis, but that's also due to my parents helping me pay for insurance a lot of the time.

I had no idea how I was going to go about fixing any of this at the time, but one thing I knew for sure was that until I had a better grip on my mental health, romantic relationships had to stop. In fact, I realized I had better learn how to actively suppress just about every urge or instinct I had when it came to dating or romantic feelings because falling deeply for someone only to have my mental health inevitably be the root of our relationship's failure, only served to make the self-loathing worse.\n", '\n', "Seeing as how dysfunctional I already was, and just how erratic and unreliable my moods were becoming, making the decision to step away from dating altogether was easy, and allowed me to just focus on myself completely.

Symptoms like racing thoughts (which I've always had and affect my ability to sleep), and feeling utterly depressed despite being at a point where I was also feeling better than ever are two of the biggest red flags.

I'd also recommend doing something challenging - maybe something like learning a language. That sounds really fucking stupid, I know, but you might be shocked at what a difference it can make.

So its tough; I understand what you're going through.\n", '\n', "I take Lamictal and Depakote for Bipolar disorder, Intuniv and Vyvanse for ADHD, as well as Lexapro for anxiety; I as well am on 5 medications (although I take medication holidays from Vyvanse on days when I don't have school/work and on the weekends). So I, like you, also take Lamictal. Since starting it, I feel like it has definitely leveled out my moods and protects me from falling too deeply into depression. **But** Lamictal (and Depakote) can be beneficial for those with ADHD who have rapidly changing moods and impulsivity, as well. So responding well/poorly to Lamictal (or any mood stabilizer, actually) isn't a clear indicator of Bipolar Disorder. On the flip side, Intuniv (similar to clonidine) has been life changing for my ADHD, more so than any stimulant I've tried. So clearly, gauging how accurate a disorder is based on responses to medications is super difficult.\n", '\n', 'One thing to keep in mind is that ADHD medications, specifically the stimulants like Adderall, Vyvanse, Concerta, Ritalin, etc. will make *anyone* feel better. Their effect isn\'t exclusive to patients with ADHD. Anyone who takes them will have increased energy/productivity/attention span/focus, all to some degree. So in that sense specifically, responding well to ADHD medication doesn\'t indicate an ADHD diagnosis. I don\'t mean to say this applies to you, as you already *have* an ADHD diagnosis. But as a general rule of thumb for others, people shouldn\'t assume that feeling amazing when taking Adderall means they "need" it.

At the end of the day, my advice is to remember that ADHD and Bipolar, just like any other mental health diagnoses, can occur simultaneously. Its not uncommon to have both. Actually, for patients who do have a comorbidity, Bipolar and ADHD is one of the more common. So don't let the amount of medications you take scare you. Try to remember that each one plays a role, and its more important that you feel better on five medications than feeling worse by only taking 3.

I was diagnosed ADHD very young and with anxiety / mild depression later in life which remained untreated until I became bi-polar and out of control in a completely manic episode. Sought treatment and a psych evaluation after my immediate family started showing concern. I\'ve always had a bad temper and anger issues which includes extreme outbursts, even damaging my own home more than once. I\'m usually grouchy, sarcastic and defensive. My wife and brother call it "don\'t poke the bear" attitude. Once my wife realized I was manic and rapidly cycling bi-polar she asked that I get a psychiatric evaluation and they kept me for 3 days in a crisis management unit. After my little vacation to the psych ward for 3 days I was put on Depakote which helps a ton and Vistaril which I use on an as needed basis for panic attacks. The Depakote helps you stop and think before talking or acting out. It lubricates the little part of your brain that is responsible for this thought process. Anger issues and especially the outbursts are the worst. Hurting those closest to you and not allowing others to get close to you. It happens so fast. But the psych meds have helped and even just a clear diagnosis has helped. I start back therapy with my counselor later this month. I have been on and off adderall and other adhd stims almost my whole life. After detoxing and focusing on my anxiety &amp; sobriety (not drinking is key!) I realized maybe my adhd was just a symptom of my extreme anxiety and constant panic attacks. Fear is the motivator behind all of my anger and outbursts. I\'m unclear on if I\'ll get back on a smaller dose of adderall I\'ll let my psychiatrist decide that. Just keep at it man. Mental health is the most important thing! \n', '</post>\n', '\n', '

I had always wanted to kill myself (still do, it's a constant notion in the back of my mind) but my sense of duty to others, family, friends, etc. precluded my doing so. One Sunday the mental pain became so difficult that my brain brushed all thoughts of duty aside and said go to it, you're entitled to do so, you can't take anymore. That's when I walked down to the beach fully clothed and out into the ocean. There were circumstances that kept me from finishing the task when I was quite a ways out. When I got back to shore, it all seemed so strange to me. I was still quite fine with the thought of killing myself but had the thought that perhaps there was something not quite right in that. It was the first little glimpse to me that something might be wrong with me mentally. The thought had simply never occurred to me until that point. My Dr. friend diagnosed me and it went from there.

Then I wouldn't be so full I'd feel ill when the meds kicked in, but also if I didn't want to eat later, at least I already ate something before. As for the sleep issues, yeah, it messed up my sleep initially, handled that by taking the first dose early and the second one as early as possible in the afternoon so it would wear off by night. I'm not sure how fast Ritalin is metabolized, and XR stuff is different than IR here. The pdoc or pharmacist might be able to guide the dosing specifics.\n", '</post>\n', '\n', '

My dad was diagnosed as bipolar (only after I did the involuntary commitment) and he self-medicates with alcohol. My dad was also 60 at the time I did the involuntary commitment, and his symptoms had getting worse over a number of years. \n', '\n', "The main reason I chose to do the involuntary commitment was because he had a pending felony court case and his actions were likely to cause him to get more charges filed against him. My sister and I did research long ago to prep for this day so we finally decided to enact our plan because this was getting into last resort territory. Using involuntary commitment, as I think you know, should be used as a last resort if you think she is a danger to herself or to others. Karen is going to be super pissed off during this time and probably afterwards. You should probably prepare for that and be prepared to hear some awful things. The benefit of involuntary commitment for me was that I got a diagnosis of bipolar and alcoholism. Before I only had alcoholism and a feeling there was a mental illness involved. Karen is diagnosed so you wouldn't get this same benefit. After my dad was released, he was still in absolute denial that anything was wrong with him and that he was going to sue me for filing a false report (lawsuit never happened). At least Karen is aware of the diagnosis and I don't know if she accepts it. She may realize how much you helped her after some time after the involuntary commitment. Just going to be honest here, my dad pretty much blames me for all his problems after the involuntary commitment even though I'm in a city far away. The chance of Karen not trusting your bf is there. For me, since my dad didn't accept the diagnosis and even stayed longer than normal stay at the hospital (usually people get released in 48 hours, he stayed 5 days).\n", '\n', "It doesn't appear, at least to me, Karen quite hits the mark of danger to herself or to others so I would still just ask Karen how she feels and try to see if she will explain her daily routine or recent activity to get an idea of what's going on and where she's coming from. Like someone else has said, explain your feelings, offer help (with boundaries), and just accept whatever answer she gives you, good or bad. Everyone that I've seen improve in real life and on reddit wants help and wants to get better. If Karen doesn't want to get better or help, then that's her choice.\n", '\n', 'As followup, you and your bf can consider the following things:\n', "1) Attend a nearby NAMI support group to see if people in your area have similar experiences. It's not helpful in terms of improving my situation, but it comforts me that there are groups of people out there that can provide some modicum of support\n", "2) Figure out what needs to happen if you do need to do involuntary commitment. Know the law and the procedure. If possible, figure out Karen's medical insurance information or take a picture of her insurance card. This way, if the worst happens, then you'll be ready. Also vet out the place you want to take her and their requirements/costs. Involuntary commitment isn't free (at least in area) so be aware of any deductible that may need to be paid. I know living in a rural area, it might be tough to find a place close by, but just realize it's a short stay. It's just to help Karen stabilize.\n", "3) Learn more about bipolar. You're on this subreddit. Great start! There is also BipolarSOs.\n", "4) Realize your limits and think about your boundaries. Make sure your bf doesn't get overwhelmed by taking time for himself and has boundaries with Karen. You're both in college which is tough enough.\n", '\n', 'Wish you both the best of luck.\n', '</post>\n', '\n', '

Reading your story, I was reminded so much of what happened to me in college. I didn\'t know I was ill - I wasn\'t diagnosed until decades later. I hear you talking a lot about your tendency to compare yourself and your life to others. This was really hard for me too, but what I had to ultimately reach - and I know you\'ll get there in time - was a mindset that basically placed me in my own special trajectory - and part of it was realizing that no one really understood (except my therapist) how fucking hard it is to operate normally under the conditions of our illness. School takes incredible discipline, and the stress is unbearable even without dealing with bipolar, so the fact that you\'ve made it this far is such a testament to your determination. I\'m really sorry your parents aren\'t more supportive. Maybe you could buy them a book about it or something, mail it to them, say "Mom, Dad - I am really struggling and I really need you. I want you to read this so you can better understand me."

It\'s kind of flawed because if I say yes it\'s situationally appropriate to feel x way, it could be my mania deciding that. So my answer to that is this test: if you don\'t ask yourself if your (possibly manically-apprehended) mood is a result of mania, it could be mania, but if you ask if you\'re manic after apprehending whether or not your mood is situationally appropriate, you\'re most likely not manic, because mania rarely questions itself. Then it\'s best to trust yourself and your [temporary] sanity. \n', '\n', "Only people who've had experience with mania have to seriously question their sanity, but the side effect is that having experienced mania causes an insanity of serious self-questioning.  But it is when (after having experienced mania) we stop questioning ourselves that we need to worry about our sanity. \n", '\n', "Having said that, you're questioning yourself and the root of some of your inherent qualities - which is natural given the nature of being diagnosed with such a bitch of a disorder - but that generally indicates a healthy amount of self-awareness and inhibition. Those last two qualities totally go out the window during fully manic episodes, which are the distinguishing characteristics of bp1 diagnosis.\n", '</post>\n', '\n', '

I was hospitalized 4 times in the past year, and gave up all hope of ever getting a security clearance because of that. So I started acting out.  Smoked weed for the first time, started drinking, and generally acting recklessly. Then I met someone who was impressed with my technical skills and relatively high up in a security contracting firm, and was willing to get me on the path for a security clearance. So I stopped smoking and generally got my shit a little bit more together. I was still struggling though, including learning how to deal with a debilitating movement disorder. I got sent to the er by strangers several times. I saw a fuckton of doctors. Eventually we got the movement thing under control, but in the process of reviewing my history I got diagnosed with bipolar. I was pissed because you cannot get a security clearance with this diagnosis. However, it was probably the best thing that happened to me. My long depressive episode went away when I finally got on the right meds. I was able to return to school. I'm not saying everything is perfect but at least now I know what is wrong with me and am working with a psychiatrist and therapist to figure shit out. Eventually I realized there are much better opportunities out there outside of the government. Honestly, you are young. Your health is more important than one of many possible careers, particularly one that has such a bad rep for service people ending up in a shitty place in terms of mental health, future career and education prospects, and that offers little to no help with either issue. Your health comes first. What is the point of getting in to the military if you are going to be miserable and might end up doing something you regret because you are not getting the help you need?\n", '</post>\n', '\n', '

I hadn't really thought about their perspective and need for processing or juust being hosed. I guess I might not be ok again yet. My therapist found out because she saw me in the middle of the episode and became concerned (I was still in denial and was even thinking that being hypomanic was good for me), but my psychiatrist doesn't know yet. I didn't tell her about last time, because it was so brief and I honestly forgot in the middle of craziness from the semester. I'm scared to tell her about this time though. I'm scared she might try to put me on an atypical antipsychotic. I've been on several in the past, though not at the same time, as people where trying to control my depression that wasn't responding to SSRIs or SNRIs, my panic disorder that was only responding to daily high doses of benzos, and also for controlling a movement disorder that I eventually learned to control without meds. I think I've been on zyprexa, risperidone, abilify, Seroquel, and maybe others that I'm forgetting. They all made me feel like a zombie, like I am emotionally flat, slow down my cognitive activity significantly, make me sleep stupid amounts like 12-16 hours/day consistently, and make me gain weight. Another thing I'm afraid of is that she will decide I can't be on stimulants. I got diagnosed with ADHD several months ago (and told it was strongly suspected by several mental health professionals years ago and recognized the symptoms that where appendant since early childhood but I didn't think where atypical. I grew up in a household without health insurance, a strong distrust of American doctors, and no notion of the existence of mh issues, but I digress.), but didn't start medication until a couple of months ago because I was dealing with more pressing issues. We have only tried Concerta so far, and at lower doses I felt no effects, either side effects or benefits. However ever since we switched to 54mg I have been able to actually complete activities and stopped being retarded and forgetting why I wandered into a room, and had minimal side effects. I started on this dose a couple of weeks ago, so I don't think it is the instigator, but I'm afraid she will decide it's too risky. \n", '\n', 'Edit: grammar and words\n', '</post>\n', '\n', '

Maybe ask the people I was closest to, without bringing up the word bipolar, for some of their observations.  I did that and the next time I went back she asked me how I felt about it.

It should be a conversation with your doc about how you feel, what's been going on, and then they make a diagnosis as a medical professional.  I know people who were misdiagnosed bipolar and honestly looking back they said they brought it up to their doctor and then told them what behaviors fit but left out the things that maybe didn't.

I always felt there was something more going on with me, but just assumed my GP was right. Ive never really managed well on antidepressants and would often stop taking them because of severe side effects or because they were making no positive difference. The most recent time I was prescribed antidepressants, I insisted to myself I was going to take them till I was better, couldn't go on with this untreated depression any longer. \n", '\n', 'I only got bipolar and BPD diagnosis after walking into my GP surgery, about 3 weeks after starting the antidepressants, in such a complete state that I was referred to the community mental health team. During those three weeks I\'d had a very high week (first week), colleagues were commenting at work asking what was up with me. I was just like "oh it\'s these pills, I feel amazing." Turns out I was hypomanic.\n', '\n', "The next day after the GP visit and referral, I was on top of the world, nothing wrong with me at all. I woke up on the morning wanting to do a skydive. The day after, I was back in my GP surgery, crying hysterically saying I couldn't cope with these ups and downs anymore. My GP called an ambulance and sent me to hospital where I saw the duty psychiatrist who told me to continue on the antidepressants. \n", '\n', "Anyways 5 months later I attended my referral appointment, saw a consultant psychiatrist and was immediately taken off antidepressants and put on mood stabilisers. During this past 5 month I've had completely out of personality highs for my character and severe depression where I felt like I couldn't cope, was actively making plans to end it, broke up with my partner which I attribute to my severe mood swings, couldn't go to work on a regular basis. I was backwards and forwards to my GP only to be told they couldn't do nothing more for me.\n", '\n', "Basically what I'm trying to say is if your GP isn't taking your concerns seriously, then see a specialist. Seeing a psychiatrist privately in the UK can be quite expensive which is why I waited for the NHS referral. In hindsight I wish I had just paid the money to see one straight away because these past five months have been some of the worst in my life.\n", '\n', "Now I'm on mood stabilisers, slowly titrating up and feel so much better.

My doctor gave me a (very long) booklet on BPD and as I was reading it I felt relieved that I wasn't unfixable we were just not working on all of the issues.

I still have issues with essentially co-opting other people's personalities and there are a lot of things that I don't know how I'm going to feel about them day to day but I know at my core I am me. I still get depressed or manic for long periods of time but within those episodes, I can have intense highs and lows.

In my state the options are often dismal but every county has at least one lower cost option for therapy called sliding fee. Sliding fee goes off your income and lower income pays less. No unlimited therapy options outside of school, most of these practices are overwhelmed and the pdoc's aren't as good. Other states may be more flexible and pay more, but really in USA you have 50 different mental health systems through the states . I'm still on Obamacare, but very nervous because the media sounds as if they'll repeal it and wham all subsidies get dropped right away. I'll be highly affected if ACA is repealed. Mainly because now I get help paying for insurance so I have really good coverage at a low price. The other biggie is pre-existing conditions. Before ACA when I tried to get insurance after my diagnosis no insurance company would touch me except for a $550-600 coverage from my former employment. That was called COBRA and they had to offer it for like 18 months. Fortunately I started school again and student health insurance was what I had. The student health insurance was basically a catastrophe plan. If I got very sick it helped cover the hospital and it covered meds, but copays were high, $50-60 to see a specialist. The good part was at a university student health insurance covers pdoc and therapists for free if you go to their student health center. I'm blessed because I've never gone without insurance since my diagnosis, but that's also due to my parents helping me pay for insurance a lot of the time.

I had no idea how I was going to go about fixing any of this at the time, but one thing I knew for sure was that until I had a better grip on my mental health, romantic relationships had to stop. In fact, I realized I had better learn how to actively suppress just about every urge or instinct I had when it came to dating or romantic feelings because falling deeply for someone only to have my mental health inevitably be the root of our relationship's failure, only served to make the self-loathing worse.\n", '\n', "Seeing as how dysfunctional I already was, and just how erratic and unreliable my moods were becoming, making the decision to step away from dating altogether was easy, and allowed me to just focus on myself completely.

I held on to the idea that one day I could get better if I actually knew where to turn.\n", '\n', "That has started to happen in the past month, specifically with getting a solid diagnoses of mixed-state bipolar, the signs and symptoms of which fit my history so perfectly I felt that a weight has been lifted from my shoulders.

Classic manic-depression runs in my family, so I've always been aware of the signs of that, but as I've never had the classic polar shifts between hypermania and major depression (in fact, I've never once had a hypermanic phase at all), I was quite certain that what I was dealing with wasn't bipolar disorder.\n", '\n', "Until I met with this new doctor, I had never heard of mixed bipolar disorder (or a mixed affective state), and I never knew that there are more subtle signs of mania that exist outside the stereotypical hypermanic phase I saw four months out of the year with my mom. Symptoms like racing thoughts (which I've always had and affect my ability to sleep), and feeling utterly depressed despite being at a point where I was also feeling better than ever are two of the biggest red flags. The other, bigger one, though, was the fact that when I first started taking antidepressants at 16, I felt their effects immediately; the first time I took Zoloft, I was wired for two days and couldn't sleep. I legitimately felt like I had snorted Adderal or something, and my doctor switched me to Effexor, which I also felt immediately (though without the added wired effect).\n", '\n', "Now that I have a solid diagnoses, and will soon be starting on mood stabilizers, as opposed to the wildly ineffective-for-my-condition antidepressants, and, in conjunction with therapy, I'm finally starting to feel like I'm reaching a point where I may one day (in the coming years), actually be better equipped not only for a relationship, but to process the world around me from a more stable point of view.\n", '</post>\n', '\n', '

I also found out I could use a Federal Loan Discharge thing through the same circle of organizations like FAFSA that'd allow full forgiveness of apparently any loan I'd take out from them, even the Parent Plus loan for reasonable amounts.

I'd also recommend doing something challenging - maybe something like learning a language. That sounds really fucking stupid, I know, but you might be shocked at what a difference it can make.

They can learn coping mechanisms and other ways of managing themselves. It's just their way, and it works for them. I agree know it all professionals sound annoying but it's only because they have some type of knowledge that they are willing to share with others. You can take it or leave it. I think in today's society there are SO many diagnoses that psychiatrists and therapist don't even use labels anymore. I think labels and diagnoses are more for people like us to toss around because they are interesting to all of us. Some people like talking about the diagnoses. \n", '</post>\n', '\n', '

Self-diagnosis can be really dangerous, though. Psychiatrists have been through years and years of training in order to make a diagnosis, and (source: my psychiatrist) there's a lot more that goes into a diagnosis than what's on the surface. Since mental illness is a serious medical issue, self-diagnosing it is no different than trying to self-diagnose a disease. Which, if you did, and turned out to be wrong, could even lead to death (extreme, I know, but mental health can end in death all the same). \n", '\n', "If it's just a step along the way to a real diagnosis, that's a different thing (that seems like what you're saying, too, I think).

And some psychiatrists will do pro bono work for people in need.
